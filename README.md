# Tesely
Safari extension for translating selected text on page to your language (language set in your browser/system as default).
This is quite alike a safari variant of [Google Translator for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-translate/aapbdbdomjkkjkaonfhkkikfgjllcleb) extension and uses the same undocumented API.


## Installation and usage
For now, the extension is not signed by certificate therefore you can install it only via Extension Builder in Safari: Develop -> Show Extension Builder -> + -> Add Extension -> locate the `tesely.safariextension` directory from this repo.

After successful install, everytime you select some text on web page the rotating circle will be shown. Moving mouse cursor over this circle will show a popup with translation.

## test.html
If you would like to modify the extension, you can test your modifications by opening file `test.html` localy in Safari instead of periodical reloading the extension in Safari Extension Builder.
